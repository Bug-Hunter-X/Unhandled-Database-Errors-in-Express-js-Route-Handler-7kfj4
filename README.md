# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: neglecting to handle potential errors during database queries within route handlers.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The route `/users/:id` fetches a user from a database.  However, it lacks proper error handling for cases where the database query fails (e.g., network issues, database errors). This can lead to application crashes or silent failures, making debugging difficult.

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version with comprehensive error handling using `try...catch` blocks.  This ensures that any errors during the database interaction are caught, logged appropriately, and handled gracefully, preventing application crashes and providing informative error responses to the client.
